# HPCLabs

Welcome to my HPC lab work Wiki! This repository showcases my projects and skills in High Performance Computing (HPC), developed through hands-on lab experiments and self-directed learning. My work focuses on parallel computing, GPU programming, and cluster management, with the goal of contributing to cutting-edge computational research.

This repository contains my personal HPC lab projects, including code, documentation, and tutorials. I plan on learning the following.

Parallel Programming: Implementing MPI and OpenMP for distributed and shared-memory computing.
GPU Computing: Optimizing AI workloads with CUDA and TensorFlow.
Cluster Management: Configuring SLURM and Warewulf for small-scale HPC clusters.


Explore the Wiki to learn about my projects, technical setups, and problem-solving approaches.
Featured Projects
1. Setting up the lab environment hardware.
2. Parallel Processing with rust

Key Resources

[[Setup-Guides]]: Step-by-step guides for setting up HPC environments, including software installation and cluster configuration.
[[Tutorials]]: Walkthroughs on running parallel jobs, debugging MPI errors, and optimizing GPU code.
[[About-Me]]: I am a cybersecurity student at the University of Mary in Bismarck, ND. I received my AAS in Computer Networking Technology from Yavapai College in Arizona. I was previously a system administrator, managing a small-scale VMware environment and supporting systems, i.e., Storage, networking, and backup systems, along with building the department's new VDI solution with the Xen hypervisor. 

Why This Matters
My lab work reflects my passion for solving complex computational problems and my commitment to learning HPC technologies. Each project includes code, documentation, and reflections on challenges overcome, showcasing my technical and problem-solving skills to potential employers.
